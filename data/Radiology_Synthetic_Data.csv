Case History:

Reason for Request: New onset pain / guarding/ resisting movement of left leg - painful on examination of lower tibia and ankle (left)

? Fracture, New onset pain / guarding/ resisting movement of left leg - painful on examination of lower tibia and ankle (left) ? Fracture From clinical notes: Osteogenesis imperfecta type III. Secondary hyperparathyroidism. Previous multiple fractures. Chronic kidney disease stage 4, Vitamin D deficiency, Mobility impairment.

Findings: There is diffuse osteopenia in keeping with known hyperparathyroidism. There are transverse fractures of the distal left femur, proximal and distal left tibia and fibula, with some adjacent periosteal reaction but minimal displacement. These represents pathological fractures which occurred several days ago, in a patient with pre-existing metabolic bone disease. An orthopaedic opinion regarding alignment should be considered.

"03/08/2025, 09:15, XR CHEST

Case History:

Reason for Request: new CVL LIJ Findings: Compared to 01/08/2025. Left IJV CVC projected at the junction with the brachiocephalic vein. ET tube projected slightly high at T1 level. Oesophageal temperature probe in the distal oesophagus. NG tube tip in the stomach. Pacing wires projected across the chest. Right chest drain and mediastinal drain noted. There remains bilateral perihilar bronchial wall thickening with right retrocardiac atelectasis. No measurable residual right pneumothorax. There is some left basal lucency which could reflect a tiny anterior pneumothorax. No significant pleural effusion. Old right posterior ninth rib healing fracture. Distended air filled bowel loops in the visualised upper abdomen. No pneumatosis within the field of view. Dr Michael Chen, Radiology Registrar 03/08/2025, 14:30",FALSE
"15/07/2025, 14:22, XR PELVIS AND HIPS BOTH

Case History:

Reason for Request: Patient with known osteoporosis presenting with acute onset right hip pain following minor fall. Unable to weight bear. ? Fracture

From clinical notes: Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Chronic kidney disease stage 3. Vitamin D deficiency.

Findings: Compared to 10/05/2025. There is generalised osteopenia throughout the visualised bones consistent with known metabolic bone disease. A non-displaced fracture is identified through the right femoral neck with surrounding sclerosis suggesting chronicity of approximately 2-3 weeks. The left hip appears intact with no acute fracture. No significant joint effusion. Mild degenerative changes noted at both sacroiliac joints. Soft tissue calcification noted in the right gluteal region, likely vascular in nature. The visualised lower lumbar spine demonstrates reduced bone density with compression deformity of L4 vertebral body. Orthopaedic review recommended for management of femoral neck fracture.

"12/06/2025, 10:22, XR FOOT RIGHT

Case History:

Reason for Request: Small swelling over medial dorsal side right foot and along 1st metatarsal of great toe; pain upon palpation of this area. Known reduced bone density, previous fracture in arm - rule out fracture

Findings: There is moderate osteopenia. There is a possible Salter Harris II fracture of the proximal lateral aspect of the 1st metatarsal although this is not clearly shown on the lateral view. An oblique view may help to clarify.

"18/07/2025, 09:30, CT THORAX WITH CONTRAST

Case History:

Reason for Request: Discussion in MDT regarding Lung Pathology

Findings: ASD and VSD noted, with markedly dilated right atrium. Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.

Conclusion:

Large volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission. Alert raised for incidental rib fracture.

Case History:

Reason for Request: reduced range of motion, new per physiotherapist concern, ? fracture, Rt arm stricture? injury, weakness, to rule out fracture

Findings: Symmetrical appearances with broad-based diaphyseal periosteal reaction bilaterally of both humeri, likely physiological. There are similar findings in the proximal right radius and ulna. The proximal humeral ossification centre appears symmetrical. No acute bony injury.

Case History:

Reason for Request: Abdominal distention and worsening discomfort /pain over the last 24 hrs related to feeds - BG : day 5 post PEG insertion

Findings: Gastrostomy noted. Right-sided VP shunt tubing coiled within the abdomen with tip projected over the right flank, no kink or fracture demonstrated. Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable with no evidence of obstruction. No definitive pneumatasis or free intraperitoneal gas.

"19/10/2025, 14:25, CT HEAD

Case History:

Reason for Request: 18 mo, drowsy, drop GCS 12/15 - ? changes ICP - bradycardia, hypertension and reduced conscious level

Findings and interpretation: Non-contrast CT head. No previous relevant imaging available for comparison at time of reporting. The patient was scanned using a vacuum immobilisation bag due to motion concerns. This results in a linear artefact in the anteroposterior direction, most evident at the level of the corona radiata and posterior fossa, limiting assessment in these regions -Within the above limitation, no evidence of acute intracranial haemorrhage or established territorial infarction. -No midline shift or signs of transtentorial or uncal herniation. -The foramen magnum is capacious, with no tonsillar herniation. -No acute calvarial fracture is identified. -Ventricular size and configuration are within normal limits. -No hydrocephalus or sulcal effacement.

Opinion: No acute intracranial haemorrhage, infarction, or herniation identified within the limitations of linear artefact from the immobilisation bag. No acute calvarial fracture.
